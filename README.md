# Griffin Group Global Back End Development Challenge

Hi! Thank you for your interest in [Griffin Group Global][g3website]. Our evaluation processes begins with an open-ended coding challenge that we will discuss during your interview. There is not one correct way to approach this challenge. Rather, we would like to see your approach and your creativity in solving the problem.

We appreciate that any coding challenge represents an investment of your time. We hope you see the value in having a code sample that is relatable to both of us for the interview. Should you be unsuccessful, you should feel free to use the code you developed for this challenge in any way that you would like.

If you are successful, then we will set up an in-person interview and use this code as the starting point in our conversation.

# The Challenge
Griffin Group Global uses a JavaScript-based stack currently, which means [Node.js][nodejs] on the backend. We develop microservices using Node. The challenge would be to write a microservice to Create, Read, Update, Delete and Search a specific data model. This represents a sizeable amount of work and we would not expect you to write the entire microservice. However, you are free to implement as much as you want.

## Minimum Server-side Challenge Requirements
We would like a minimum server-side capability. These are:
- A read route that returns more than one object
- A read route that returns a specific object when a specific id is specified.
- A writeup of how to use your code or better yet, a [Mocha][mocha]-based test that shows the functionality working

The basic format for the read route would conform to:

`[VERB] [base]/[type]/[id]{?param1=value1{...&paramn=valuen}}`

where:
- `VERB` represents the HTTP verb (GET, POST, etc.)
- `[]` denotes required information
- `base` denotes the base URL, such as [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- `type` denotes the microservice resource name, such as "Organization"
- `id` denotes the object ID to look up
- `{}` denotes optional values
- `param` denotes the name in the datamodel to query against
- `value` denotes the value to query for
- `â€¦` denotes that there can be any number of query parameters

## Data model
Please base your data model off of this specification for an organization.

Organization:

```js
{
  "id": "", // unique identifier
  "name": "", // name of the organization
  "addresses": [] // array of locations
}
```

Location:

```js
{
  "postal": "", // The postal address line; contains the house number, apartment number, street name, etc.
  "city": "", // Name of the city, town, village or other community or delivery center.
  "state": "", // Sub-division (e.g. state, province, or territory) of the country; abbreviations are accepted; ISO codes are not encouraged since this is a globalized field.
  "zip": "", // A postal code designating a specific region, district, or zone as defined by the United States Postal Service (USPS).
  "country": "" // Name of the country (aka nation). ISO-3166 3-letter codes can be used in place of a full country name.
}
```

## Where to concentrate your effort
In a server-side microservices approach, there are many areas that need to be developed when creating an API. While implementing the minimum requirements, please feel to implement one or more items in these areas. Please do not feel limited to these areas if you would like to add your take on microservice development.

- Error handling
  - Which HTTP Codes should be returned and under which circumstances?
  - Should the user of the API get more information than an HTTP status code?
  - Do integration tests reflect these error conditions?
  - etc.
- Debug statements
- [TDD]
- Service security
- HTTP header security
- Encrypted communications
- Caching
- Microservice health checks
- Database communications security
- Code quality, such as unit test coverage
- Style, such as using [ESLint][eslint] and specific rules, such as [Airbnb][airbnb-eslint]
- Application to showcase using the backend API

# Prerequisites
- A basic understanding of source code control, [git][git-scm] is required.
- You must make your code available via a [GitHub][github] account.
- All JavaScript shall be written using [ES6][ES6] standards.
- You should be familiar with creating data APIs.

# Getting Started
1. Fork this [repository][repository].
1. Clone the fork to your personal machine.
1. Start coding.
1. Commit changes to your fork as you see fit.

# Submission

When you are comfortable with your results, please email your fork to
[g3-dev@griffingroupglobal.com](mailto:g3-dev@griffingroupglobal.com). Please keep your emails short and to the point.

Any specific notes or further information you would like to add about your submittal, should be included in the GitHub project.

Do not feel as though you must create a public fork of this repository. You are free to create a throwaway GitHub account or private fork. In those cases, please let us know so that we may send you the GitHub IDs to add to the repository.

# Evaluations

We realize there are many items to look at when creating a microservice. Please do not feel like like you have to do everything. Please do not feel like you must use Node, albeit that is our primary language platform. If you have less security experience, but more search and database experience, then use that to your advantage in the code you write. Give us a heads up by documenting your code to let us know where and why you concentrated on certain
items.

As you develop your solution, you may have ideas on other avenues to pursue. Please feel free to include them inline as documented source or as additional [Common Mark][commonmark] compliant notes in your fork.

We look for creativity, originality, and a good user experience in your application if that's an area you focused on.

We look for readability, good architectural decisions, modularity, and a solid approach to testing in your code.
